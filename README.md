# Sales Analysis Project using Python

In this project I have used 12 months of sales data of US customers and utilised my knowledge of Python Pandas and Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions for the store. The dataset contains about electronic store purchases of different cities in US broken down by month, address, product type, quantity, and cost.
Tasks performed during my anaysis:
1. Droping all NAN values.
2. Changing datatype from object to Int or float as per required.
3. Removing rows based on condition.

After cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis was performed. Was able to answer following business related question.
1. Which was the best sales for the store? 
2. Which city/state had most number of sales?
3. Which two products are often sold together?
4. What time is best to display advertisements for the store in order to generate more sales?

This analysis can be used by the store to generate more sales by attracting more customers, by offering promotions on multiple combo deals. Providing deals on hot selling products.etc
